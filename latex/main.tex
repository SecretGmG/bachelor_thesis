\section{Introduction}
Perturbative quantum field theory (QFT) is a framework for describing the
interactions between elementary particles (quarks, leptons, gluons, etc.) in
the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics. It is essential for describing
cross-sections, decay rates, and other physical properties of particles and
interactions, that can be measured experimentally.

As experimental accuracy improves, it is increasingly important to compute
accurate higher order contributions of these expansions.

The non-trivial contribution of higher order corrections is often dominated by
loop integrals, which are increasingly difficult to compute with existing
analytical methods like integration by parts (IBP) or differential equation
systems for master integrals.

Because of this, the numerical evaluation of loop integrals has become an
active area of research in recent years. There are many different methods
available including sector decomposition implemented in
\texttt{pySecDec}~\cite{borowka_pysecdec_2018}.

Performing the integral in momentum space has the advantage easier physical
interpretation of the integrand. Certain observables can be computed directly
from the momentum space representation of the integral.

Contour deformation~\cite{capatti_numerical_2020} is a method, where the
integral is performed in momentum space. It is a technique which regularizes
integrable singularities in the integration domain by deforming the integration
contour in the complex plain. In this deformation one must be careful not to
introduce additional residues by crossing over other poles, which do not lie in
the original integration domain.

In this work, I will focus however on threshold
subtraction~\cite{kermanschah_numerical_2022}, which does not require contour
deformation. In threshold subtraction, singularities are isolated and replaced
by a locally defined counterterm that reproduces their behavior exactly at the
singular point. By subtracting this counterterm, the combined integrand remains
finite everywhere in the integration domain and can therefore be integrated via
Monte Carlo integration. Because the singularities are integrable, the
counterterm itself can be integrated analytically by choosing the
parametrization and exact form of the counterterm, such that the counterterm
itself is analytically integrable.

Existing applications, however, predominantly focus on integrals with real
internal masses. In settings involving unstable particles, complex masses are
unavoidable, and their presence modifies the location and character of the
singularities. Whether the threshold subtraction method remains stable and
reliable in this broader context is not a trivial question.

In this work, I investigate the scalar triangle integral with complex internal
masses as a controlled environment in which to test this extension. The scalar
triangle is sufficiently simple to allow for a transparent analysis, yet it
retains essential features introduced by complex masses. Demonstrating that
threshold subtraction can be applied successfully in this setting represents a
step toward its use in realistic multi-loop computations formulated within
complex-mass schemes.

\textbf{TODO:} short intro to complex mass scheme.
\textbf{TODO:} short roadmap

\section{Scalar Triangle Integral}
I consider the scalar Triangle integral, restricted to complex masses with
$\Re(m_i^2) > 0$ and $\Im(m_i^2) \leq 0$.
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \input{assets/diagrams/triangle.tex}
    \caption{Feynman diagram of the scalar Triangle integral}\label{fig:triangle_feynman}
\end{figure}
The Feynman diagram in Figure~\ref{fig:triangle_feynman} produces equation~\eqref{eq:triangle_integral}.
\begin{equation}
    I = \int \frac{\dd[4]{k}}{{(2\pi)}^4} \frac{i}{D_1 \, D_2 \, D_3} \label{eq:triangle_integral}
\end{equation}
with
\begin{equation}
    D_i = {(\vb{k}-\vb{q}_i)}^2-{\qty(m_i-i\varepsilon)}^2 = {(\vb{k}-\vb{q}_i)}^2-m_i^2 + i \varepsilon  \label{eq:denom}
\end{equation}
Notice that the feynman causal prescription $-i\varepsilon$ is included in the definition of the denominator. In this thesis, I will sometimes also write the causal prescription implicitly in the masses, i.e. $m_i \to m_i - i\varepsilon$, as it shortens some of the calculations.

The momenta $\vb{q_i}$ are defined as
\begin{align}
    \vb{q}_1 & = \vb{p_1}  \\
    \vb{q}_2 & = \vb{0}    \\
    \vb{q}_3 & = -\vb{p_2}
\end{align}

\subsection{Integration of the Loop Energy}
The structure of the singularities of the triangle
integral~\eqref{eq:triangle_integral} intricate, and the singularities are
present even for large momenta $\vb{k}^\mu \to \infty$. This can be illustrated
by considering eq~\eqref{eq:triangle_integral} in one spacial dimension. The
integrand can the be visualized for all values of $(\vb{k}^0, \vb{k^1}) \in
    \real^2$, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:1d_example}.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{assets/integrand_1D_example.png}
    \caption{Integrand of the scalar triangle integral in one dimension}\label{fig:1d_example}
    Visualization of the absolute value of the integrand of the scalar triangle integral in one spacial dimension.
    With the horizontal axis representing the $k^0$ variable and the vertical axis representing the $k^1$ variable.
    The configuration in this plot is $m_i = \SI{1}{\keV}$, $\vb{p_1} = (2, 1) \, \si{\keV}$ and $\vb{p_2} = (2, -1) \, \si{\keV}$
\end{figure}

We can however already notice, that the number of poles in the $\vb{k}^0$
variable seem to be independent of $\vb{k}^1$, this already suggests. We will
now take a closer look at the poles in the $\vb{k}^0$ variable to then
integrate along it analytically. This does not only have the huge benefit of
simplifying the singularity structure greatly, allowing for the use of
threshold subtraction, it also removes a dimension from the integration domain,
improving performance.

There are many ways to perform the loop energy integration in
eq.~\eqref{eq:triangle_integral}. Following the steps
in~\cite{catani_loops_2008} to rederive the Loop Tree Duality (LTD)
representation by integrating over the energy and then algebraically
manipulating the resulting expression to get a result in the Cross Free Family
(CFF) representation derived in~\cite{capatti_exposing_2023}.

I will perform the $k^0$ integration with Cauchy's theorem. For this we need to
consider the poles of the integrand from Eq.~\eqref{eq:triangle_integral} in
$k^0$. These are given by
\begin{equation}
    k^0 = q_i^0 \pm \qty(\sqrt{{\qty(\va{k}-\va{q}_i)}^2+m_i^2} - i\varepsilon) = q_i^0 \pm E_i
\end{equation}
with
\begin{equation}
    E_i = \sqrt{{\qty(\va{k}-\va{q}_i)}^2+m_i^2} - i\varepsilon
\end{equation}
Closing the contour around the poles corresponding to the principal square roots leads to the contour shown in Figure~\ref{fig:poles}
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \input{assets/diagrams/poles.tex}
    \caption{Poles of the denominator}\label{fig:poles}
\end{figure}

We can now apply Cauchy's theorem to perform the $k^0$ integral.
\begin{equation}
    I = \int \frac{\dd[3]{k}}{{(2\pi)}^4} 2\pi i \sum_{i= 1}^{3} \On{Res}_{k^0 = q^0_i + E_i}\qty[\frac{i}{D_1D_2D_3}] \label{eq:cauchy}
\end{equation}

Let's compute the residues.
\begin{equation}
    \On{Res}_{k^0 = q^0_i + E_i}\qty[\frac{i}{D_1D_2D_3}] = {\qty[\frac{i}{D_i'}\prod_{i \neq j} \frac{1}{D_j}]}_{k^0=q^0_i + E_i}= \frac{i}{2E_i} \prod_{i\neq j} \eval{\frac{1}{D_j}}_{k^0=q^0_i+E_i} \label{eq:residue}
\end{equation}

\newcommand{\ELIPT}[2]{\eta_{#1#2}^{++}}
\newcommand{\HYPER}[2]{\eta_{#1#2}^{+-}}

We can also introduce $\ELIPT{i}{j}$ called E-Surface and $\HYPER{i}{j}$ called
H-Surface.

\begin{align}
    \eval{D_j}_{k^0=E_i} & = {\qty(q^0_i+E_i-q^0_j)}^2 - \overbrace{{\qty(\va{k}-\va{q}_j)}^2+m_j^2}^{E_j^2}                                                              \\
                         & = E_i^2+{q_i^0}^2+{q_j^0}^2-2q_i^0q_j^0+2q_i^0E_i - 2q_j^0E_i-E_j^2                                                                            \\
                         & = \underbrace{\left(E_i+E_j+q_i^0-q_j^0\right)}_{\ELIPT{i}{j}}\underbrace{\left(E_i-E_j+q_i^0-q_j^0\right)}_{\HYPER{i}{j}} \label{eq:surfaces}
\end{align}
Inserting the results from Eq.~\eqref{eq:surfaces} and Eq.~\eqref{eq:residue} into Eq.~\eqref{eq:cauchy} we get the Loop Tree duality expression.
\newcommand{\BLTD}[3]{2E_{#1}\ELIPT{#1}{#2}\HYPER{#1}{#2}\ELIPT{#1}{#3}\HYPER{#1}{#3}}
\begin{equation}
    I =  \int \frac{\dd[3]{k}}{{(2\pi)}^3}\qty(\frac{1}{\BLTD{1}{2}{3}}+\frac{1}{\BLTD{2}{1}{3}}+\frac{1}{\BLTD{3}{1}{2}}) \label{eq:ltd}
\end{equation}

While this is a nice expression, it is not yet suited for numerical
integration, since all of the H-Surfaces contain singularities which would make
the procedure numerically unstable. It turns out however that these
singularities are spurious and can be removed by purely algebraic
manipulations, shown in detail in Appendix~\ref{sec:improved_ltd}. The
resulting expression contains only E-Surfaces.

\begin{gather}
    I =  \int \dd[3]{k} \mathcal{I}_{CFF} \\
    \mathcal{I}_{CFF} = \frac{1}{{(4\pi)}^3} \frac{1}{E_1E_2E_3} \qty(
    \frac{1}{\ELIPT{2}{1}\ELIPT{3}{1}}
    + \frac{1}{\ELIPT{1}{2}\ELIPT{1}{3}}
    + \frac{1}{\ELIPT{1}{2}\ELIPT{3}{2}}
    + \frac{1}{\ELIPT{2}{1}\ELIPT{2}{3}}
    + \frac{1}{\ELIPT{1}{3}\ELIPT{2}{3}}
    + \frac{1}{\ELIPT{3}{1}\ELIPT{3}{2}}
    )
    \label{eq:cff}
\end{gather}

\subsection{Cross Free Family}
Equation~\eqref{eq:cff} can also be derived directly using a diagrammatic approach, derived in~\cite{capatti_exposing_2023}.

It shows, that the CFF representation can be obtained by summing over all possible acyclic edge orientations of the given graph. In the case of the triangle, there are six possible edge orientations $S = {\{+,-\}}^3 \setminus \{(+,+,+), (-,-,-)\}$.

\begin{align}
\mathcal{I}_{CFF} &= \frac{1}{{(2\pi)}^3}\frac{1}{\prod_{m=1}^{3} 2i\,E_m} \sum_{\va{\sigma} \in S} \hat{\mathbbm{1}}_{\va{\sigma}}\\
&=\frac{1}{{(4\pi)}^3} \frac{-1}{E_1E_2E_3} \qty[\TriDiag{-}{+}{+} + \TriDiag{+}{-}{+} + \TriDiag{+}{+}{-} + \TriDiag{+}{-}{-} + \TriDiag{-}{+}{-} + \TriDiag{-}{-}{+}]
\end{align}

Note that up to permutations of the indices all of these diagrams are equivalent. We will therefore consider one diagram, and note that the result is symmetric under the exchange of the indices. It is shown in~\cite{capatti_derivation_2023}, how this diagram can be evaluated by recursively retracting contracting edges.

\begin{equation}
    \TriDiagLabeled{+}{-}{+} \quad = \frac{i}{\tilde{E}_1 + \tilde{E}_2} \frac{i}{\tilde{E}_1 + \tilde{E}_3}
\end{equation}
where $\tilde{E}_1 = E_1 - \sigma_1 q_1^0$.
Thus the sum of the $\tilde{E}_1$ values corresponds exactly to the e-surface $\ELIPT{1}{2}$

\begin{equation}
    \tilde{E}_1 + \tilde{E}_2 = E_1 + E_2 - \sigma_1 q_1^0 - \sigma_2 q_2^0 = \ELIPT{1}{2}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    \TriDiagLabeled{+}{-}{+} = \frac{-1}{\ELIPT{1}{2}\ELIPT{1}{3}}
\end{equation}


\section{E-Surface}
Equation~\eqref{eq:cff} can still contain singularities, which need further
treatment to be integrated numerically. The equation is singular when an
E-Surface $\ELIPT{i}{j}$ is zero. For threshold subtraction to work, we will
need to characterize these singularities. In the case of complex masses, this
characterization needs some extra care. We need to make sure to find the zeros
of the E-Surface in the complex plane, rather than in the real plane.

Let us introduce the momentum $\va{k'}$ defined in equation~\eqref{eq:k_prime}.
\begin{equation}
    \va{k'} = \va{k} - \frac{\va{q}_i}{2}(\va{q}_i+\va{q}_j) \label{eq:k_prime}
\end{equation}

Defining $\vb{q} = \frac{1}{2}\qty(\vb{q}_i-\vb{q}_j)$, the E-Surface condition
simplifies to the following form.
\begin{equation}
    \ELIPT{i}{j} =  \sqrt{{(\va{k'}-\va{q})}^2+m_i^2} + \sqrt{{(\va{k'}+\va{q})}^2+m_j^2} + 2q^0 \overset{!}{=} 0\label{eq:e_surface}
\end{equation}
\subsubsection{E-Surface existence condition}\label{sec:e_surface_exist}
%Maybe First do simplified case with $m_i = m_j = m$. show that it is indeed ellipsoid.
Noticing that the E-Surface is of the same form as~\eqref{eq:identity} we can
perform the following steps to remove the square roots.
\begin{equation}
    \sqrt{A}+\sqrt{B} + C = 0 \label{eq:identity}
\end{equation}
We can already find a necessary but not sufficient condition for the existence of the E-Surface. Considering equation~\eqref{eq:identity} and remembering that we assume $\Re(m_i^2) > 0$ and $\Re(m_j^2) > 0$ we find that for any solution to exist, the following identity must hold
\begin{equation}
    \Re(C) = 2 q^0 < 0 \label{eq:e_surface_existence_condition}
\end{equation}
This condition already excludes exactly half of the E-surfaces from having any solutions. We will now precede with the characterization of the solutions of the identity~\eqref{eq:identity}.
\begin{align}
    \sqrt{A}+\sqrt{B} + C =                              & 0                        \\
    \implies\quad 2\sqrt{AB}                             & = C^2-A-B                \\
    \implies\quad 4AB                                    & = {(C^2-A-B)}^2          \\
    \implies\quad C^2 - 2(A+B) + {\qty(\frac{A-B}{C})}^2 & = 0 \label{eq:identity2}
\end{align}

\subsubsection{Treatment of extraneous solutions}
The steps taken to derive equation~\eqref{eq:identity2} may introduce
extraneous solutions to the E-Surface equation~\eqref{eq:e_surface}. I propose
and compare two methods to remove these extraneous solutions.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Numerical Check Existence Condition:}\\
          Check solutions by inserting and checking if the expression evaluates to $0$.
          This is very easy to implement numerically, but in practice it will
          unfortunately need to rely on floating point precision. It is also necessary to
          perform this check per sample, which in turn means that samples concerning the same E-surface may be excluded / included depending on the solid angle $\hat{\vb{k}}$.

    \item \textbf{Minimum Value Existence Condition:}\\
          Compute the minimum value of $\sqrt{A}+\sqrt{B}+C = 0$ over the reals. If it is
          negative, then there exist solutions with $\Re(A)>0$ ans $\Re(B)>0$ and thus
          the following steps can not introduce extraneous solutions. If the minimum
          value is positive, then the following steps may introduce extraneous solutions.
          This method may remove some valid solutions, but it is guaranteed to not
          introduce extraneous solutions. Valid solutions removed in this way necessarily
          lie in the complex plane. We can easily compute the minimum value of
          the equation~\eqref{eq:e_surface} by noticing that it is convex and solving for
          $\nabla_{\va{k'}} \ELIPT{i}{j} = 0$, which yields
          \begin{equation}
              \va{k'}_{\text{min}} = \frac{m_j-m_i}{m_i+m_j} \va{q}
          \end{equation}
          We can then compute the minimum value of the E-Surface equation~\eqref{eq:e_surface} by evaluating it at this point.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{E-surface characterization}
The E-Surface equation~\eqref{eq:e_surface} rewritten using
equation~\eqref{eq:identity2}.
%\begin{align*}
%    A-B &= -4\va{k'}\cdot \va{q} + m_i^2 - m_j^2\\
%    A+B &= 2\va{k'}^2 + 2 \va{q}^2 + m_i^2 + m_j^2
%\end{align*}
Which yields the following equation after some simplifications.
\begin{equation}
    4{q^0}^2 - 2 \qty(2\va{k'}^2 + 2 \va{q}^2 + m_i^2 + m_j^2) + {\qty(\frac{-4 \va{k'}\cdot \va{q} + m_i^2 - m_j^2}{-2q^0})}^2= 0
\end{equation}
This equation can be further simplified, showing that it is quadratic in $\va{k}'$. Note, that $\vb{q}^2 = {q^0}^2 - \va{q}^2$.
%\begin{equation}
%    \vb{q}^2-\frac{m_i^2 + m_j^2}{2} - \va{k'}^2 + {\qty(\va{k'}\cdot \frac{\va{q}}{q^0})}^2 - 2 \qty(\frac{m_i^2 - m_j^2}{4q^0}) \qty(\va{k'}\cdot \frac{\va{q}}{q^0}) + {\qty(\frac{m_i^2 - m_j^2}{4q^0})}^2 = 0
%\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    \va{k'}^2 - {\qty(\va{k'}\cdot\va{v})}^2 - 2 \Delta \qty(\va{k'}\cdot\va{v}) - \vb{q}^2 + \braket{m^2} + \Delta^2 = 0 \label{eq:quad_k_prime}
\end{equation}
with
\begin{equation}
    \va{v} = \frac{\va{q}}{q^0}
    \qquad
    \braket{m^2} = \frac{m_i^2 + m_j^2}{2}
    \qquad
    \Delta = \frac{m_i^2 - m_j^2}{4q^0}
\end{equation}
\subsection{E-surface in hemispherical coordinates}
To perform threshold subtraction we will need to find the roots of
equation~\eqref{eq:quad_k_prime} along a given line $k = k\,\hat{\vb{k}} +
    \va{k_0}$. In this parametrization we have
\begin{equation}
    \va{k'} =  k\,\hat{\vb{k}} + \underbrace{\va{k_0} - \frac{1}{2}(\va{q}_i+\va{q}_j)}_{\va{k'_0}} \label{eq:parametrization}
\end{equation}
The roots of equation~\eqref{eq:quad_k_prime} in the radial variable $k$ in the parametrization~\eqref{eq:parametrization} are given by the following quadratic equation.

\begin{equation}
    \alpha k^2 + \beta k + \gamma = 0 \label{eq:quadratic_k}
\end{equation}
with
\begin{align}
    \alpha & = 1-{\qty(\hat{\vb{k}}\cdot\va{v})}^2                                                                             \\
    \beta  & = 2(\hat{\vb{k}}\cdot\va{k'_0})-2(\hat{\vb{k}}\cdot\va{v})(\va{k'_0}\cdot\va{v})-2\Delta(\hat{\vb{k}}\cdot\va{v}) \\
    \gamma & = \va{k'_0}^2-{\qty(\va{k'_0}\cdot\va{v})}^2-2\Delta(\va{k'_0}\cdot\va{v})-\vb{q}^2+\braket{m^2}+\Delta^2
\end{align}
This quadratic equation can be solved with the standard quadratic formula, and thus always has exactly two complex valued solutions, which we will call $k^*_+$ and $k^*_-$. These solutions need to be checked for validity with one of the proposed methods.

\subsection{Equal-mass case}~\label{sec:equal_mass_case}
It is worthwhile to consider the case where $m_i = m_j = m \in \real$ to build
geometric intuition of the solutions. In this case the quadratic
equation~\eqref{eq:quadratic_k} simplifies, and the geometry of the solutions
is more transparent.

Choosing the parametrization~\eqref{eq:parametrization} with $\va{k'_0} =
    \va{k_0}$, we get
\begin{equation}
    k^2 = \frac{\vb{q}^2-m^2}{1-{\qty(\hat{\vb{k}} \cdot \va{v})}^2} \label{eq:quadratic_k_simple}
\end{equation}
Considering that if the external momenta are onshell, we find that $\norm{v} < 1$, this ensures that we do not divide be zero, and the sign of the denominator is always positive.g
Thus we can see, that real solutions for $k$ only exist if $\vb{q}^2-m^2 > 0$. In this case equation~\eqref{eq:quadratic_k_simple} defines a prolate spheroid. This is the shape of the E-surface for equal-mass particles.
In Figure~\ref{fig:e_surf_example} we see an example of an E-surface in the equal mass case.

\begin{figure}[H]

    The major axis is shown in red, the length of which was obtained from the quadratic equation~\eqref{eq:quadratic_k_simple}, the direction of the major axis was obtained as $\va{v}/\norm{\va{v}}$.

\section{Threshold Subtraction for one E-Surface}\label{sec:thresh}
Threshold singularities appear whenever a loop momentum $\va{k}$ is on an
E-surface. These integrable singularities make numerical integration of the
integrand impossible, if not treated appropriately.

The idea of threshold subtraction is straightforward: isolate the pole
generated by a single E-surface and subtract a locally defined counterterm that
reproduces its behavior exactly at the singular point. This ensures that the
combined integrand remains finite everywhere in the integration domain. In a
well chosen parametrization, it suffices to integrate along a a single
dimension to integrate over the pole. This integration can be performed
analytically, or with some oder stable procedure, thus eliminating the
singularity entirely.

In resent approaches, only singularities lying exactly in the integration
domain are considered for threshold
subtraction~\cite{kermanschah_numerical_2022,kermanschah_numerical_2024,capatti_loop_2019}.
In this thesis I extend this idea to singularities that are not exactly in the
integration domain, but instead are shifted to the complex plane. While not
strictly necessary for the convergence of the integrand, this extension allows
for a more general treatment of singularities and improves numerical stability
in cases where the singularities are very close to the integration domain.

\subsection{Subtraction of a single E-Surface}
To remove the threshold singularity corresponding to an E-surface, we will
define a local counterterm for an integrand of the form
\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{I} = \frac{f_{ij}(\va{k})}{\ELIPT{i}{j}}
\end{equation}
where $f_{ij}$ is the coefficient of $\ELIPT{i}{j}$, i.e., the factor that remains after factoring out $\ELIPT{i}{j}$ from the integrand.
The zeros of $\ELIPT{i}{j}$ along the radial direction can then be found with Eq.~\eqref{eq:quadratic_k}.

Denote the set of solutions, checked for validity with one of the methods
described in Section~\ref{sec:e_surface_exist}, as $\mathcal{K}_{ij}$, it
contains at most two solutions.

The singular behavior of the integrand can fully be captured by the first-order
taylor expansion in $\ELIPT{i}{j}$ around a pole, located at $k^* \in
    \mathcal{K}_{ij}$.
\begin{equation}
    \ELIPT{i}{j} = 0 + (k-k^*) \underbrace{\eval{\pdv{k} \ELIPT{i}{j}}_{\va{k}=\va{k^*}}}_{\eta'_{ij}} + \order{{(k-k^*)}^2}
\end{equation}
We can now define a counterterm that will cancel the singularity at $k^*$
\begin{equation}
    \on{CT}_{ij, k^*}(k) = \chi (\va{k}) \frac{f(\va{k^*})}{(k-k^*) \, \eta'_{ij}}
\end{equation}
where $\chi (\va{k})$ is an arbitrary mask, that is smooth at $\chi (\va{k}^*) = 1$ and vanishing as $\abs{k-k^*} \to \infty$
The partial derivative along the radial variable $k$ is straightforward to compute explicitly.
\begin{equation}
    \eta'_{ij} = \eval{\pdv{k} \ELIPT{i}{j}}_{\va{k}=k^* \hat{\vb{k}} } = {\qty[\frac{1}{E_i}(\va{k}-\va{q}_i)\cdot \hat{\vb{k}} + \frac{1}{E_j}(\va{k}-\va{q}_j)\cdot \hat{\vb{k}} ]}_{\va{k} = k^* \hat{\vb{k}}}
\end{equation}

By construction, subtracting the counterterm $\on{CT}_{ij}(k^*)$ will remove
the singularity at $k^*$ from the integrand.

\subsection{Radially integrating the counterterm}
The choice of the mask $\chi$ determines many properties of the counterterm. We
can write the radial integral in hemispherical coordinates centered at
$\va{k_0}$
\begin{equation}
    I_{\on{CT}_{ij}} =  \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \dd{k} {k}^2 \on{CT}_{ij, k^*} (\vec{k})
\end{equation}
with
\begin{equation}
    \va{k} = k \hat{\vb{k}} + \va{k_0}
\end{equation}

Several useful observations can be made on the choice of $\chi$.
\begin{itemize}
    \item By choosing $\chi = \frac{{k^*\pm}^2}{k^2}$, the Jacobian factor $k^2$ is
          canceled, leaving a simple $\frac{1}{k-k^*}$ integrand for the radial integral.
          Care must be taken when canceling the Jacobian factor this way. The
          parametrization of the subtracted integrand must match the parametrization of
          the counterterm, or other additional steps must be taken, to not introduce
          additional singularities into the integrand. In this thesis we will only
          consider the case where the counterterm is parametrized in the same way as the
          integrand.
    \item If $\chi = \frac{{k^*}^2}{k^2} f(k)$ where $f$ is an even function, the real
          part of the integration vanishes, simplifying the computation.
\end{itemize}

For our purposes we choose a mask that is only nonzero in a finite region and
cancels the Jacobian factor.
\begin{equation}
    \chi{\va{k}} = \begin{cases}
        \frac{{k^*}^2}{k^2} & \abs{k\Re(k)-\mu} < \lambda \\
        0                   & \text{else}
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}
With the real valued hyperparameter $\mu$ and $\lambda$. For a succesful subtraction we need to make sure, that the pole of the counterterm is inside the mask, i.e. $\abs{\Re(k^*)-\mu} < \lambda$.
With this choice the radial integral becomes particularly simple
\begin{equation}
    \int \dd{k} I_{\on{CT}}(k^*) = \int_{\mu - \lambda}^{\mu + \lambda} \dd{k} \frac{1}{k-k^*} = \ln(\frac{\mu + \lambda-k^*}{\mu-\lambda-k^*})
\end{equation}
In the special case, where $\mu = \Re k^*$, the real part vanishes due to symmetry around $\Re k^*$, leaving
\begin{equation}
    \int \dd{k} =  -i \qty(\pi + 2\arctan(\frac{\Im k^*}{\lambda}))
\end{equation}
This result is consistent with the result derived in~\cite{capatti_exposing_2023} as $\Im k^* \to 0$
\section{Multiple E-Surfaces}
When starting to consider multiple E-surfaces we can simply add the
counterterms for each E-surface separately.

Without loss of generality we can reorder $\vb{q}_i$ such that $\vb{q}_1 <
    \vb{q}_2 < \vb{q}_3$. Thus the existence condition derived in
equation~\eqref{eq:e_surface_existence_condition} is fulfilled for the
E-Surfaces $\ELIPT{i}{j}$ with $i<j$. Each of these may require it's own
counterterm.

Consider $\ELIPT{1}{2}$ as an example, to compute the factor $f_{12}$ we need
to collect all factors containing $1/\ELIPT{1}{2}$ from
equation~\eqref{eq:cff}.
\begin{equation}
    \ELIPT{1}{2} \frac{1}{{(4\pi)}^3}\frac{1}{E_1E_2E_3} \qty(\frac{1}{\ELIPT{1}{3}}+\frac{1}{\ELIPT{3}{2}}) = \ELIPT{1}{2} \, f(\va{k})
\end{equation}
The counterterm removing the pole at either $k^*\in \mathcal{K}_{12}$ is therefore given by
\begin{equation}
    \on{CT}_{12}(k^*) = \chi(k-k^*) \, f(\va{k}) \,\frac{1}{\eta'_{12}} \,  \frac{1}{k-k^*}
\end{equation}
The same procedure applies to $\ELIPT{2}{3}$ and $\ELIPT{1}{3}$

\subsection{Definition of the full integral}
For the numerical final numerical integration it is useful to combine the
everything into a single integral. This approach improves compiler optimization of
the integrand and may also improve numerical stability by better capturing
correlations and cancellations between the different parts.

There are many ways to add the radially integrated counterterm back into an
integrand over $k \in \real^3$. For now we will consider a general mask $g(k)$, which is normalized along the radial variable $k$.
\begin{equation}
    \int \dd{k} k^2 g(k) = 1
\end{equation}

By introducing factors $\mathbf{a}, \mathbf{b}, \mathbf{c} \in \{0,1\}$ to
scale the original integrand, the counterterm and the integrated counterterm we
can then also use a single implementation to evaluate any of the relevant integrands,
by setting the appropriate factors to zero.

\begin{equation}
    I =
    \int \dd[2]{\hat{\vb{k}}} \int \dd{k} k^2 \qty[ \mathbf{a}\;\mathcal{I}_{CFF} +
    \sum_{i<j} \sum_{k^* \in \mathcal{K}_{ij}}
    \qty( -\mathbf{b}\;\text{CT}_{ij}(k^*) + \mathbf{c}\;g(k)\,I_{\on{CT}_{ij}}(k^*))] \label{eq:integrand}
\end{equation}

We will consider two different functions $g(k)$
\begin{equation}
    g(k) = \Theta(\lambda - \abs{\Re(k)-\mu}) \frac{3}{(\mu+\lambda)^3 - (\mu-\lambda)^3}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    g(k) = \exp(-\frac{(\Re(k)-\mu)^2}{\lambda^2}) \frac{1}{\sqrt{\pi} \lambda (\mu^2 + \frac{\lambda^2}{2})}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Local cancellation in Counterterm}
\textbf{TODO:} Explain what might be a problem, and why it is not.

\section{Numerical implementation}
The numerical integration is performed with the Python API of the
\texttt{Symbolica} library \texttt{Symbolica} supports compilation of symbolic
expressions into optimized assembly code for fast evaluation. It also provides
an efficient implementation of the \texttt{VEGAS} Monte Carlo integration
algorithm, which is well suited for this problem.

\subsection{Parametrization}
\texttt{Symbolica} provides efficient sampling in $N$-dimensional hypercubes.
There are many reasonable choices to map from the unit hypercube to hemispherical coordinates. I choose the following mapping from unit hypercubes to the relevant parametrizations with their respective Jacobians $J$.

\textbf{Unit Hemisphere}

\begin{equation}
    \vb{\hat{k}}(u, v) =
    \begin{pmatrix}
        \sin(\phi) \cos(2 \pi w) \\
        \sin(\phi) \sin(2 \pi w) \\
        \cos(\phi)
    \end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}
with
\begin{equation}
    \cos(\phi) = 1 - 2 v\qquad
    \sin(\phi) = \sqrt{1-\cos^2(\phi)}\qquad
    J_{\vb{\hat{k}}} = 2 \pi
\end{equation}

\textbf{Hemispherical coordinates}

\begin{equation}
    \va{k}(u, v, w) = r \vb{\hat{k}}(u, v)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    \tilde{u} = 2\,u-1 \qquad
    r = \tilde{u} - \frac{1}{\tilde{u}} \qquad
    J = \frac{r^2 \, J_{\vb{\hat{k}}}}{{(1-\tilde{u})}^2}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Reference}
The \textit{OneLOop} package~\cite{hameren_oneloop_2011} provides
implementation for scalar loop integrals with up to 4 legs. I will use the open
source package
\textit{OneLOopBridge}\footnote{\url{https://github.com/SecretGmG/OneLOopBridge}}
that was written in conjunction to this thesis to compute the reference values
for the integrals.\textit{OneLOopBridge} provides Python and Rust bindings for
the \textit{OneLOop} package, which is written in fortran. A more detailed description of the usage of \textit{OneLOopBridge} can be found in Appendix~\ref{sec:oneloopbridge}.

\section{Small regularizing masses}\label{sec:regularizing_masses}
It is possible to regularize the integral by adding a small imaginary part to
the masses. In this example I show the effect of this regularization on the
numerical stability of the integral. As the regularization becomes smaller the
threshold subtraction becomes necessary to ensure numerical stability of the
integral.

For this example we use a configuration where minimum value existence condition
is met for every E-surface with $i<j$. Due to this choice the radial solutions
are guaranteed to be valid.

The external momenta in this example are chosen, such that they are aligned
with the $z$-axis and in the COM-system. The masses in this example are always
chosen to be equal $m_i = m$.

\begin{align*}
    \vb{p_1}^2 = \SI{1}{\GeV^2} \qquad \vb{p_2}^2 = \SI{3}{\GeV^2} \qquad {(\vb{p_1}+\vb{p_2})}^2 = \SI{8}{\GeV^2}\qquad \Re(m) = \SI{0.2}{\GeV}
\end{align*}

The threshold subtraction radius $\lambda$ is chosen to be $\lambda = 2.5$.

It is now possible to visualize the threshold subtraction using complex masses
to regularize the integrand, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:threshols
    subtraction}.
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{assets/threshold_subtraction.png}
    \caption{Threshold Subtraction}\label{fig:threshols subtraction}
    Visualization of the threshold subtraction, with complex mass regularization $\Im(m) = \SI{-0.01}{\GeV}$.
    The unsubtracted integrand, the counterterm and the subtracted integrand are shown in the $xz$-plane. The colormap is such the brightness corresponds to the absolute value of the function and the hue corresponds to the phase, with cyan corresponding to positive values and red corresponding to negative values.
\end{figure}

The integration is performed using the complex mass regularization for
$-\Im(m)$ approaching zero. We can measure the convergence of the monte carlo
integration using the coefficient of variation, defined as the standard
deviation divided by the mean. The result of the numerical integration is shown
in Figure~\ref{fig:cv_mass_reg}.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{assets/mass_regularization_convergence.png}
    \caption{Coefficient of variation of the complex mass regularization}\label{fig:cv_mass_reg}
\end{figure}

\section{Threshold masses}

We will now take a closer look at what happens in configurations with real
masses, where imaginary solutions to the E-surface
equation~\eqref{eq:e_surface} exist. We will check if subtracting the imaginary
solutions in these cases improve numerical stability.

Using the same kinematic configuration as in
Section~\ref{sec:regularizing_masses} and equal internal masses $m_i = m$,we
will vary the mass to check numerical stability of the integral as E-surfaces
cross the boundary of having real to complex solutions.

\begin{align*}
    \vb{p_1}^2 = \SI{1}{\GeV^2} \qquad \vb{p_2} 2 = \SI{3}{\GeV^2} \qquad {(\vb{p_1}+\vb{p_2})}^2 = \SI{8}{\GeV^2} \qquad \Im(m) = 0
\end{align*}

Using the E-surface existence condition for the equal mass case derived in
Section~\ref{sec:equal_mass_case} we can compute the values of the masses where
the E-surface equation~\eqref{eq:e_surface} goes from having real to complex
solutions. We will call these masses threshold masses. For this example they
are
\begin{equation}
    m^2 = \SI{0.25}{\GeV} \qquad m^2 = \SI{0.75}{\GeV} \qquad  m^2 = \SI{2}{\GeV}
\end{equation}

Plotting the integral over a range including all of these threshold masses
shown in Figure~\ref{fig:threshold_masses_integral} we see that, at least
superficially, both methods of subtracting E-surfaces converge well on the
correct result. We can also note that for masses larger than the largest
threshold mass, the imaginary part of the integrand is equal to zero. This is
expected, because in this case no singularities exist in the real valued
integrand, that could introduce any imaginary part.

It is important to note however, that for the per-sample method, the imaginary
part of the integrand is not equal to zero, even in this region, because
complex solutions of the E-surface equation get subtracted. As we can see, the
per-sample method still converges well in this case, showing that the imaginary
parts of the counterterm and integrated counterterm cancel themselves out
exactly.

The numerical stability of the two methods can be compared better, when
plotting the Coefficient of variation, as shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:cv_threshold_masses}. Somewhat surprisingly, the global method
converges better than the per-sample method, this is likely because in the
per-sample method the imaginary part of the integrand is not equal to zero,
introducing unnecessary variance, while in the global method it is.

\section{Anomalous thresholds}
\textbf{TODO:} Explain why they are interesting, explain why and how to choose the integration center, as i did, show numerical stability, compute the integral exactly on the threshold~\cite{passarino_peaks_2018}

In this example we consider a configuration with fixed masses $m_1 = m_2 =
    m_\text{Top}, m_3 = m_\text{Bottom}$ and fixed external momenta $\vb{p}_1^2$
and ${(\vb{p}_1+\vb{p}_2)}^2$, varying $\vb{p_2}^2$. This configuration is
discussed in~\cite{passarino_peaks_2018}, which allows us to compare the
results.

To take full advantage of the local cancellations, it is important to choose
the integration center such that it is inside all of the E-surfaces that
intersect.
