	abstract = {We derive a duality relation between one-loop integrals and phase-space integrals emerging from them through single cuts. The duality relation is realized by a modification of the customary +i0 prescription of the Feynman propagators. The new prescription regularizing the propagators, which we write in a Lorentz covariant form, compensates for the absence of multiple-cut contributions that appear in the Feynman Tree Theorem. The duality relation can be applied to generic one-loop quantities in any relativistic, local and unitary field theories. \%It is suitable for applications to the analytical calculation of \%one-loop scattering amplitudes, and to the numerical evaluation of \%cross-sections at next-to-leading order. We discuss in detail the duality that relates one-loop and tree-level Green's functions. We comment on applications to the analytical calculation of one-loop scattering amplitudes, and to the numerical evaluation of cross-sections at next-to-leading order.},

	abstract = {We propose a new approach that allows for the separate numerical calculation of the real and imaginary parts of finite loop integrals. We find that at one-loop the real part is given by the Loop-Tree Duality integral supplemented with suitable counterterms and the imaginary part is a sum of two-body phase space integrals, constituting a locally finite representation of the generalised optical theorem. These expressions are integrals in momentum space, whose integrands were specially designed to feature local cancellations of threshold singularities. Such a representation is well suited for Monte Carlo integration and avoids the drawbacks of a numerical contour deformation around remaining singularities. Our method is directly applicable to a range integrals with certain geometric properties but not yet fully generalised for arbitrary one-loop integrals. We demonstrate the computational performance with examples of one-loop integrals with various kinematic configurations, which gives promising prospects for an extension to multi-loop integrals.},

We demonstrate that our construction is systematic and efficient by applying it to more than 100 examples of finite scalar integrals featuring up to six loops. We also showcase a first step towards handling non-integrable singularities by applying our work to one-loop infrared divergent scalar integrals and to the one-loop amplitude for the ordered production of two and three photons. This requires the combination of our contour deformation with local counterterms that regulate soft, collinear and ultraviolet divergences. This work is an important step towards computing higher-order corrections to relevant scattering cross-sections in a fully numerical fashion.},

Here, technical details of this calculation are presented. These include the algebraic reduction of spinor chains to a few standard structures and the consistent implementation of the finite width of the W boson. To this end, a generalization of the complex-mass scheme to the one-loop level is proposed, and the practical application of this method is described. Finally, the effects of the complete O(alpha) corrections to various differential cross sections of physical interest are discussed and compared to predictions based on the double-pole approximation, revealing that the latter approximation is not sufficient to fully exploit the potential of a future linear collider in an analysis of W-boson pairs at high energies.},

We then engineer a triangulation that has a direct diagrammatic interpretation in terms of a straightforward edge-contraction operation. We use it to develop an algorithmic procedure that performs the Fourier integrations in closed form, yielding the novel Cross-Free Family three-dimensional representation of loop integrals. Contrary to the {TOPT} and {LTD} representations, its singularity structure is entirely and elegantly expressed in terms of the graph-theoretic notions of connectedness and crossing.

	abstract = {Scattering amplitudes at loop level can be expressed in terms of Feynman integrals. The latter satisfy partial differential equations in the kinematical variables. We argue that a good choice of basis for (multi)loop integrals can lead to significant simplifications of the differential equations, and propose criteria for finding an optimal basis. This builds on experience obtained in supersymmetric field theories that can be applied successfully to generic quantum field theory integrals. It involves studying leading singularities and explicit integral representations. When the differential equations are cast into canonical form, their solution becomes elementary. The class of functions involved is easily identified, and the solution can be written down to any desired order in 𝜖 within dimensional regularization. Results obtained in this way are particularly simple and compact. In this Letter, we outline the general ideas of the method and apply them to a two-loop example.},
