# Notes

## Next steps

- Do from scratch implementation
- make rust and py bindings for oneloop
- make sure complex masses still work in ltd
- naively integrate the complex mass
- do it with threshold subtraction
- use enumx crate instead of ugly macro
- make all the code deterministic!

## Logbook

- September read up on qft theory
- week 40: read up on ltd
- week 41: started and solved most of theory in theoretical exercises
- week 42: implemented the non-optional portions of the coding part
- week 42: implemented core of non-optional portions from scratch
